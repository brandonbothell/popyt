# Examples
First of all, I recommend that you check out [the documentation](https://bbothell.me/better-youtube-api/docs) for all of the methods and what they return. Here are some basic methods:

Instantiate the object:

```js
const { YouTube } = require('better-youtube-api')
const youtube = new YouTube(apiKey)
```

Instantiate the object without caching:

```js
const { YouTube } = require('better-youtube-api')
const youtube = new YouTube(apiKey, { cache: false })
```

Get a video by ID:

```js
const video = await youtube.getVideo('dQw4w9WgXcQ')
console.log(video)
```

Get a video by URL:

```js
const video = await youtube.getVideo('https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ')
console.log(video)
```

You can do the same thing with playlists, channels, comments, and more by replacing `Video` with the resource you want.

Note: This wrapper does not implement every feature of the YouTube API. With a single developer working on it, there just isn't time for everything to be implemented. Some of the objectively most-important features have been added. The limits imposed by the wrapper are not imposed by YouTube.
